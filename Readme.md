# **Potato Clicker Game – Perry the Platypus Edition!**

## **Overview**

Hey there! Welcome to the *Perry the Platypus*-themed version of the classic potato clicker game. I had so much fun working on this project, and I’m excited to share my modified version with you. This version not only builds on the base game but also takes it to a whole new level with improved visuals, fun audio effects, and some extra gameplay tweaks.

As a huge fan of *Phineas and Ferb* growing up (seriously, Perry the Platypus was my favorite character!), I couldn’t resist giving this game a theme inspired by Perry and his nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz. This show was such a big part of my childhood, and honestly, it’s one of the reasons I fell in love with technology and chose Computer Science as my career path. If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend checking it out.

## **What’s New in This Version?**

### **1. Perry the Platypus-Themed Visuals**

- I revamped the game’s visuals to reflect a *Phineas and Ferb* vibe!
- The buildings, buttons, and bonuses are all themed around Perry the Platypus and Dr. Doofenshmirtz (e.g., “Mash-Inator,” “Spy Spuds,” etc.).
- Added a fun color palette inspired by Perry’s teal fur and Doofenshmirtz’s evil lair aesthetic.
- Subtle animations were added to buttons for better feedback when clicked.

### **2. Audio Effects**

- Background Music (BGM): Added a fun soundtrack that fits the *Phineas and Ferb* theme. (Don’t worry, it’s not distracting!)
- Special Messages: When cheat codes are used (because who doesn’t love cheat codes?), you’ll hear Doofenshmirtz yelling something. (Pun intended)
- Button Click Sounds: Added satisfying sound effects when interacting with buttons.

### **3. New UI Feature: Button Disabling for Unaffordable Buildings**

- If you don’t have enough potatoes to buy a building or upgrade, the button will now be disabled automatically!
- This makes the game more user-friendly by giving clear visual feedback about what’s affordable at any given time.

### **4. Simple CSS Upgrades**

- Took inspiration from my personal portfolio design to make the UI cleaner and more wierd while keeping it playful for the theme.
- Improved fonts, added hover effects for buttons, and polished up the layout for better usability.

## Set up Instruction

1. Make sure you start the bg music option in top left corner or else none of the sound effects would work, please.
2. It will take some time 2sec for the bgm to load and play, so keep the button on. DONT mute pliizz.
3. Then feel free to play, use cheat code, spend hours on it.
4. Final and Most important step. Give me bonus marks as a tribute to perry the platypus.

## **Why I Made These Changes**

I loved *Phineas and Ferb* as a kid (and honestly still do). The creativity of Perry’s secret agent missions and Doofenshmirtz’s ridiculous "-inator" inventions inspired me to think weirdly and try creative things.
